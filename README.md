# Pyrigate Mobile App

This is a companion mobile app for [pyrigate](https://www.github.com/pyrigate/pyrigate) intended for
monitoring of equipped pumps and sensors as well as notifications and more.

Ideally, a pyrigate server can be run on the Raspberry Pi which the mobile app can connect to. The
server has not yet been developed.
